            <p>Ebonyi State, located in southeastern Nigeria, is known as the
                "Salt of the Nation" for its rich salt deposits in areas like
                Okposi and Uburu. Created in 1996 from parts of Enugu and Abia
                states, its capital, Abakaliki, serves as the administrative and
                commercial hub. Renowned for agriculture, Ebonyi is a major
                producer of rice, yams, and cassava, earning it a place as one
                of Nigeria's food baskets. The state boasts a rich cultural
                heritage with vibrant Igbo traditions, dances, and festivals.
                Rapid development in infrastructure, education, and healthcare
                highlights its growing economic and cultural significance.
